# Sight-Challenge-ENICarthage

This is the Project Prototype made By IEEE ENICarthage Student Branch  for the "Tunisians Students and Young Profesionnals 9th edition"'s Sight Challenge named "Akdhili".

## What is Akdhili ?

Akdhili is a platform developped to reduce the problem of unobtainable products in Tunisia , but how does it achieve that ?
Well, to begin with, Akdhili will use a database shared with other governmental institutions that contains Tunisian citizens and Residents informations , since the creation of their account.
Akdhili then will re-use those informations which will greatly decrease stress on Markets , also, when using Akdhili , a form will appear containing additionnal informations needed to complete those services.
By doing that, the user will only have to go to the nearest market to his house  for buying those products  , etc...
